Configure an optional config file as basis

Hello

I would be happy to have a 

> yarns
> 	.config({
> 		optionalExtends: 'config.json'
> 	})
> 

that would load the config.json if it exists, and would not fail if the file does not exists.

Does that exists already?

> 	.config({
> 		extends: 'config.json'
> 	})

fail if the file config.json does not exists...

If it does not exists, I would be happy to contribute with a PR

Thanks for this great program !
